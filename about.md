I began my coding journey in **class 6** when my teacher introduced me to C, sparking a passion for computer science and technology. My enthusiasm for the field grew when I started watching **Google I/O** in 2017, with AI capturing my interest 🤖. Since then, I’ve focused on strengthening my problem-solving skills and broadening my technical knowledge.

### Key Milestones 🚀

- **Completed Harvard's CS50** (Nov 2021) 📚: This course solidified my understanding of computer science fundamentals and broadened my technical horizons.
- **Developed multiple projects** in Python and C 🐍💻: Created tools for mathematical problem-solving, including linear programming and matrix calculations.
- **Gained proficiency with Git and GitHub** 🔧: Acquired skills in version control and development tools that are essential for collaborative coding.
- **Participated in Hacktoberfest** 🎉: Earned a shirt and stickers for my contributions to open-source projects.
- **Created a Python-SQL interface** 🗃️: Developed a user-friendly GUI to improve interaction with SQL databases.
- **Built a YouTube video downloader** 📹: Designed a tool for downloading both single videos and playlists in the highest quality.
- **Led the school's ATAL Tinkering Lab** 🛠️: Created hardware projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, fostering hands-on learning and innovation.
- **Explored the Linux kernel and various Linux distributions** 🐧: Successfully created a basic Arch Linux installation, deepening my understanding of operating systems and system internals.

### My Focus and Approach 🔍

Due to the nature of my introduction to computer science and technology, I tend to focus on projects that either:
- **Automate tasks for personal efficiency** 🤖💡
- **Create a significant impact on the public** 🌍

This approach keeps me engaged and allows me to immerse myself deeply in my projects.

### Languages I Am Proficient In 🗣️

- **Proficient** in **C** and **Python** 💻
- **Syntactical knowledge** of **C++**, **HTML**, and **CSS** 🌐
- **Extremely basic knowledge** of **Rust**, **Java**, and **JavaScript** 🌟

I haven’t focused extensively on mastering individual languages, so I might not know all the technical terms. However, I have strong practical knowledge and experience with many languages, and a solid grasp of programming fundamentals. This allows me to quickly pick up new languages and become proficient in them.

### Collaboration and Growth 🤝

I am eager to collaborate on various projects, whether it’s:
- **Exploring syntactical knowledge** of different languages 💬
- **Creating projects** that broaden my understanding of programming and the world of computer science 🌐

Let’s build something great together!
