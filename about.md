title: About  
---

I began my coding journey in **Class 6** when my teacher introduced me to C, sparking a passion for computer science and technology. My enthusiasm for the field grew when I started watching **Google I/O** in 2017; I was amazed by this thing called Artificial Intelligence. At that time, the development of truly **Artificially Intelligent software** was accomplished by people with years of research and strong programming fundamentals. Since then, I’ve focused on broadening my theoretical and technical knowledge and strengthening my problem-solving skills.
