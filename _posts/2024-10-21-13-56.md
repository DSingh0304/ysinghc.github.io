I have emailed my simulator_output folder to maam a few days ago, lets see am i doing it right in the mean time I did try to run the rest of the models and some the seemed to run fine with non errors however a few them were telling me that they were out of memory. Now i had htop running and it still had enough ram unless it was giving output higher than 10gbs. I also tried it with my friends laptop with much better gpu and ram and it still crashed.
